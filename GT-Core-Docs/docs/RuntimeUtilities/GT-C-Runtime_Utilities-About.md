## üõ†Ô∏è Integration

To integrate Gorgeous Core into your project, simply add the plugin to your project's Plugins directory.  Then, you can utilize the provided classes and functions in your C++ code. For example:

```cpp
// Example usage
#include "GorgeousCoreUtilitiesMinimalShared.h"
// ... your code ...
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (C++ only)

To configure Gorgeous Core, you need to add "GorgeousCoreRuntimeUtilities" to the PublicDependencyModuleNames/PrivateDependencyModuleNames array in your project's Build.cs file.  This ensures that your project can access the necessary runtime components. ¬† 

```c#
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "GorgeousCoreRuntimeUtilities" });
PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "GorgeousCoreRuntimeUtilities" });
```

## ü§î Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Question:** What does the `GorgeousSingleton.h` template do?

**Answer:** It provides a convenient way to create singleton UObject classes, ensuring only one instance of the class exists. This is useful for manager classes or other objects that need to be globally accessible.


**Question:** How can I use the logging functionality?

**Answer:** The `GorgeousLoggingBlueprintFunctionLibrary.h` provides Blueprint Callable functions (e.g., `LogInformationMessage`, `LogWarningMessage`) to easily log messages with different levels of importance. Also the correct usage of this class is also documented here.
