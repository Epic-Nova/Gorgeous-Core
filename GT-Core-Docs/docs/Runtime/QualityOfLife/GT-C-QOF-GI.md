# ‚ú® Gorgeous Game Instance (Blueprint & C++)

???+ info "Short Description"

    The `UGorgeousGameInstance` class extends the standard Unreal Engine `UGameInstance` by adding an object variable system, allowing you to store and manage persistent data across level transitions and game sessions.

??? info "Long Description"

    `UGorgeousGameInstance` enhances the standard Unreal Engine `UGameInstance` by integrating with the Gorgeous Things object variable system. It provides a structured way to store and access persistent data through the `AdditionalGorgeousData` property, which is a map of named object variables. This allows you to maintain game state, settings, and other important data that needs to persist across level transitions or be globally accessible throughout your game.

## üöÄ Features

### `AdditionalGorgeousData`
=== "üìù Function Details"

    <div class="function-description">

    A map of object variables that extends the standard game instance with persistent data storage capabilities. This property allows you to store various types of data that need to persist across level transitions or be accessible throughout the game.

    </div>

    === "Property Details"

        |   Property             |   Type                                           |   Description                                                                     |
        | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        |   `AdditionalGorgeousData` |   `TMap<FName, UGorgeousObjectVariable*>`  |   A map of named object variables that store additional data for the game instance. |

    ??? tip
        You can use this property to store various types of data, such as:
        - Cached save game data
        - Current game settings
        - Player preferences
        - Global game state information
        - Any other data that needs to persist across level transitions

    ??? note "Important"

        Each entry in the map is associated with a unique name and is represented by an `UGorgeousObjectVariable`. When new entries are added in the editor, their `UniqueIdentifier` is automatically updated.

        </figure>

    === "C++"

        ```cpp
        // Accessing data from the AdditionalGorgeousData map
        UGorgeousGameInstance* GameInstance = Cast<UGorgeousGameInstance>(GetWorld()->GetGameInstance());
        if (GameInstance)
        {
            // Get a specific object variable by name
            UGorgeousObjectVariable* MyData = GameInstance->AdditionalGorgeousData.FindRef(FName("MyDataName"));
            if (MyData)
            {
                // Use the object variable
                // ...
            }
        }
        ```

## üîß Implementation Details

The `UGorgeousGameInstance` class uses several helper macros to simplify its implementation:

- `UE_DECLARE_QOF_CLASS_INIT_INVOKE_ADDITIONAL_DATA`: Used in the `Init` function to initialize the additional data.
- `UE_DECLARE_QOF_CLASS_POST_EDIT_CHANGE_PROPERTY`: Used to handle property changes in the editor.

These macros are defined in the `GorgeousQualityOfLIfeHelperMacros.h` file and provide a standardized way to implement common functionality across different classes in the Gorgeous Things ecosystem.

## üîÑ Integration with Object Variables

The `UGorgeousGameInstance` class integrates with the Gorgeous Things object variable system, allowing you to store and manage persistent data. This integration provides several benefits:

1. **Persistence**: Data stored in object variables persists across level transitions and game sessions.
2. **Type Safety**: Object variables provide type safety and validation for stored data.
3. **Serialization**: Object variables can be easily serialized for saving and loading.
4. **Network Replication**: Object variables support network replication for multiplayer games.

To use this functionality, you need to:

1. Create a custom game instance class that inherits from `UGorgeousGameInstance`.
2. Add object variables to the `AdditionalGorgeousData` map in the editor or at runtime.
3. Access the object variables through the map using their names.
